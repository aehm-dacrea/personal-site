      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="bio">I'm here doing this, doing that and some other stuff. 
        I ❤ reading and reviewing articles, writing to my friends some summaries I've made 
        during my everyday reading. August 2019 - I've just started to learn MERN web dev stack and my next step
         after finishing my first bootcamp is to learn deeper React/Redux</p>

        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <p class="skill-text">When I was 16 years old my father gave me strong motivation to study myself
          and to approach every single problem with mindset that I'm able to solve
          anything. Since then I've solved a big bunch of problems where I had to gain
          high scored professional results, at the start of the journey knowing nothing
          how to approach them. </p>

        <h3>Embedded Systems & IOT Programming</h3>
        <p class="skill-text">Last year I was occupied, with designing and building my own IOT b2b
           commercial projects parallel with my University studies. It was
           great experience for me to learn more about systems' architecture."</p>
